## Introduction
This lab shows you how to discover and mask sensitive data in your Autonomous Database by using the Data Discovery and Data Masking features in Oracle Data Safe.

Estimated Lab Time: 30 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you'll:

- View sensitive data in your database
- Discover sensitive data in your database by using the Data Discovery feature
- Mask sensitive data in your database by using the Data Masking feature
- Create a PDF of the Data Masking report
- Validate the masked data in your database


### Prerequisites

To complete this lab, you need to have the following:

- An Oracle Cloud account
- Access to an Autonomous Database as the `ADMIN` user, sample data for Oracle Data Safe loaded into the database, and the Discovery and Masking features enabled on your database
- Access to an Oracle Data Safe service
- Privileges in the Oracle Data Safe Console to use the Discovery and Masking features on your database

### Assumptions

- You are signed in to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console. If not, please refer to the [Getting Started](?lab=getting-started) page.
- You completed the [Provision and Register an Autonomous Database](?lab=lab-1-provision-register-autonomous) lab in this workshop.
- The target database name used in the example screenshots is ad01. Your data values will most likely be different.



## **STEP 1**: View sensitive data in your database

In this step, you use Oracle Database Actions to query sensitive data in your database. You can access Database Actions from your database's Console.

1. Select the browser tab that is signed in to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console. If needed, sign in again.

2. In the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console, make sure the correct region is selected in your tenancy.

3. From the navigation menu, select **Autonomous Transaction Processing**.

4. Under **COMPARTMENT**, make sure that your compartment is selected.

5. Click the name of your database.

6. On the **Autonomous Database Details** page, click the **Tools** subtab.

7. In the **Database Actions** section, click **Open Database Actions**. A new browser tab is opened displaying the **Oracle Database Actions | Sign in** page.

8. In the **Username** field, enter `ADMIN`, and then click **Next**.

9. In the **Password** field, enter the password that you created for the `ADMIN` user when you provisioned the database, and then click **Sign In**.

10. Under **Development**, click **SQL**.

11. If a help note is displayed, click the **X** button to close it.

12. On the **Navigator** tab, select the `HCM1` schema from the first drop-down list. In the second drop-down list, leave **Tables** selected.

16. On the toolbar, click the **Run Statement** button (green circle with a white arrow) to execute the query.

  ![Run Statement button on toolbar](images/run-statement-button.png)

17. Review the query results. If needed, click the **Query Result** tab.

    - Data such as `employee_id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, `phone_number`, and `hire_date`, are considered sensitive data and should be masked if shared for non-production use, such as development and analytics.

    - Keep this tab open so that you can return to it later. In step 4, you compare the original query results with the masked data.

## **STEP 2**: Discover sensitive data by using Data Discovery

The Data Discovery wizard generates a sensitive data model that contains sensitive columns in your target database. When working in the wizard, you select the sensitive types that you want to discover in your target database.


1. Return to the browser tab for the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console. If needed, sign in again.

2. From the navigation menu, select **Data Safe**. The **Overview** page for the Oracle Data Safe service is displayed.

3. Click **Service Console**. The **Home** page in the Oracle Data Safe Console is displayed.

4. To access the Data Discovery wizard, click the **Data Discovery** tab.

5. On the **Select Target for Sensitive Data Discovery** page, select your target database, and then click **Continue**.

  ![Select Target for Sensitive Data Discovery page](images/select-target-for-sensitive-data-discovery.png)


6. On the **Select Sensitive Data Model** page, leave **Create** selected, enter **SDM1** for the name, enable **Show and save sample data**, select your compartment, and then click **Continue**.


7. On the **Select Schemas for Sensitive Data Discovery** page, scroll down and select the **HCM1** schema, and then click **Continue**.

  ![Select Schemas for Sensitive Data Discovery page](images/select-schemas-for-sensitive-data-discovery.png)


8. On the **Select Sensitive Types for Sensitive Data Discovery** page, expand all of the categories by moving the slider to the right, and then scroll down the page and review the sensitive types. Notice that you can select individual sensitive types, sensitive categories, and all sensitive types.

10. When the job is completed, ensure that the **Detail** column states **Data discovery job finished successfully**, and then click **Continue**.

  ![Detail column](images/sensitive-data-discovery-complete.png)


11. On the **Sensitive Data Discovery Result** page, examine the sensitive data model created by the Data Discovery wizard. Oracle Data Safe automatically saves your sensitive data model to the Oracle Data Safe Library.

12. To view all of the sensitive columns, move the **Expand All** slider to the right.

    ![Sensitive Data Discovery Result page](images/sensitive-data-discovery-result.png)

13. From the drop-down list, select **Schema View** to sort the sensitive columns by table name.

    ![Schema View circled](images/schema-view.png)

14. Scroll down the page to view the sensitive columns.

    - You can view sample data (if it's available for a sensitive column) and estimated data counts.

    - In particular, take a look at the sensitive columns that Data Discovery found in the `EMPLOYEES` table. Columns that do not have a check mark, such as `MANAGER_ID`, are called referential relationships. They are included because they have a relationship to another sensitive column and that relationship is defined in the database's data dictionary.

    - Review the sample data provided to get an idea of what the sensitive data looks like.

    ![Sensitive columns list](images/employees-table-sample-data.png)


15. To generate the **Data Discovery** report, scroll to the bottom of the page, and then click **Report**.


16. Review the **Data Discovery** report.

    - The chart compares sensitive categories. You can view totals of sensitive values, sensitive types, sensitive tables, and sensitive columns.

    - The table displays individual sensitive column names, sample data for the sensitive columns, column counts based on sensitive categories, and estimated data counts.
