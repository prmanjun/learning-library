# Connect to ADB
## Introduction
Included with Oracle REST Data Services, Oracle SQL Developer Web is the web-based version of Oracle SQL Developer that enables you to execute queries and scripts, create database objects, build data models, and monitor database activity.

Oracle SQL Developer Web runs in Oracle REST Data Services and access to it is provided through schema-based authentication. To use Oracle SQL Developer Web, you must sign in as a database user whose schema has been enabled for SQL Developer Web.

In Oracle Autonomous Database databases, the ADMIN user is pre-enabled for SQL Developer Web.
