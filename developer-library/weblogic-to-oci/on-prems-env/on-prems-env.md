# Setup the Demo 'On-Premises' Environment

## Introduction

For this migration workshop, we need an environment to migrate *from*.

We're offering 2 ways to provision this environment:

- Using a demo Marketplace image for this workshop
- Using Docker, locally on your development machine

Both paths provide a pre-packaged 'on-premises' simulated environment which includes an Application Database and a WebLogic domain including 2 web applications and a datasource to connect to the database.

The Marketplace image deployment is simpler and faster, while the Docker environment provides a way to more realistically simulate an 'on-premises' environment as it runs on your local machine.

Estimated Lab Time: 15 to 30 minutes depending on path chosen.

### Objectives

In this workshop, you will:

- Choose a path to create a demo environment to use as the 'on-premises' environment.

### Prerequisites

*Depending on the path you choose, there a different requirements:*

For the Marketplace environment, you will need:
- One compute instance with 4 OCPU available

For the Docker environment, you will need:
- A machine with at least 3 CPUs and 6GB of memory to allocate to the Docker engine

## **STEP 1:** Choose a path

Choose the option that best suits your needs:

A. [Setup the on-premises environment using Marketplace image (15min)](?lab=lab-1-option-setup-on-premises-environment)

B. [Setup the on-premises environment using Docker (30min)](?lab=lab-1-option-b-setup-local-(on-premises))

*When you are done with the workshop, you should tear down the 'on-premises' environment.*

You may proceed to the next lab.

### Disclaimer

Note that this is a demo environment pre-packaged with a WebLogic Domain, demo applications and a Database inside a single VM. This is for demo/training purpose only and is not production-ready.
