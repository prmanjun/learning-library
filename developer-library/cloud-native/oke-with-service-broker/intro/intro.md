# Introduction

## About this Workshop

This lab will walk you through the process of deploying an Oracle Kubernetes Engine (OKE) cluster with the OCI Service Broker (OSB).

OCI Service Broker lets you manage the lifecycle of services such as Autonomous Database (ATP or ADW), Object Storage or Streaming as kubernetes objects.

Estimated Lab Time: 60min

### Objectives

*Deploy an OKE cluster with OCI Service Broker installed with Terraform*

In this lab, you will:
- Install the prerequisite software needed to run a terraform deployment and deploy kubernetes manifests
- Deploy an OKE cluster with the OCI Service Broker.
- Provision an example Autonomous Database with Kubernetes.
- Provision an example Object Storage Bucket with Kubernetes
- Provision an example Stream with Kubernetes.
