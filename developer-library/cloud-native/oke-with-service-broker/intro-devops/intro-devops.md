# Introduction

## About this Workshop

Developing on Kubernetes while connecting to services that only live on the cluster can be challenging.

This lab will walk you through a template for developing applications for Kubernetes on a live cluster, publishing the application and service images, and deploying to dev, staging and production environments.

We'll cover how to setup the kubernetes resource and use **Kustomize** to templatize for different environments, as well as develop and debug containers on a remote cluster with **Skaffold**.

This workshop makes use of the OCI Service Broker to manage the lifecycle of a streaming service and an Autonomous Transaction Processing Database. We'll go over deploying an Oracle Kubernetes Engine (OKE) cluster with the OCI Service Broker (OSB).

Estimated Lab Time: 60min

### Objectives

*Discover how to develop, debug, and deploy applications for Kubernetes on a live OKE cluster*

In this lab, you will:
- Install the prerequisite software needed to run a terraform deployment and deploy kubernetes manifests
- Deploy an OKE cluster with the OCI Service Broker.
- Learn how to use Kustomize (the templating utility for Kubernetes) to parametrize multiple environments.
- Learn to use Skaffold to develop container applications
- Learn to use Skaffold to debug containers on a live cluster
- Learn to use Github Actions to automate testing and deployment.

### Prerequisites

*In order to run this workshop you need:*

* A Mac OS X, linux or Windows machine with Windows Subsystem for Linux as all commands to be used are shell commands.
* A private/public SSH key-pair
* A OCI account with a Compartment setup

***If you are not an administrator on your tenancy, you must insure that the following policies have been set for you:***

```
<copy>
Allow group MyGroup to manage groups in tenancy
Allow group MyGroup to manage dynamic-groups in tenancy
Allow group MyGroup to manage policies in tenancy
Allow group MyGroup to manage volume-family in tenancy
Allow group MyGroup to manage instance-family in tenancy

Allow group MyGroup to inspect tenancies in tenancy
Allow group MyGroup to use tag-namespaces in tenancy

Allow group MyGroup to manage all-resources in compartment MyCompartment
</copy>
```
***If your administrator won't let you create users and groups / policies, as required, you may need to have the administrator perform the OKE deployment steps and provide access to the cluster.***


You may proceed to the next lab.
