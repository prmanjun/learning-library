# Building Microservices with Oracle Converged Database
## Introduction and Overview

There is a rapid increase of data streams being generated by applications, devices, the wide web, processes and enterprises which need to be processed, stored and analyzed securely and at scale. There are many technologies to address these event streams, but the key is to recognize that event-driven action is the end goal of these event streams. You can think of event-driven workflows in ERP, CRM and HCM that have event flows, which were traditionally using JMS messaging. Or they could be streaming news, sensor data or social media posts sent to various sets of Apache Kafka subscribers.

Often there are tough architecture choices for setting up the infrastructure, operating it, tuning it, upgrading it and scaling it. In this workshop you will simplify the process by setting up Transactional Event Queues in the Oracle Autonomous Database which brings the best of JMS messaging and Kafka produce/consume together with transactions. This combination of data and and events delivered with notifications is ideal to build scalable microservices using a multi-model, multi-tenant architecture.

This workshop will help you understand the technical capabilities inside and outside the Oracle database to support scalable data and event-driven microservices architecture.

You will create a highly scalable application that relies on Oracle Container Engine for Kubernetes to build, deploy and manage the Helidon and WebLogic front-end microservices that interact through Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Service Broker, JMS and Kafka streaming platform with the back-end datastores deployed as Oracle pluggable databases inside Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing.

Note that a few minor steps (such as the creation of OCI Vault secrets, etc.) have changed from this video and the documentation should be followed. 
We will be updating the video soon.
