# Introduction

## About this Workshop

This hands-on lab provides users with step-by-step instructions for preparing their **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Tenancy**, including setting up a user group, adding a user and policies, as well as a compartment to house **Cloud Manager 11 using Marketplace**. The final sections provide guidance for **provisioning a PeopleSoft environment**, followed by interactive, yet simple excercises to familiarize users with the system.


Estimated Lab Time: 6 hours, including provisioning time. 


**Note**:

- The workshop is quite detailed and technical. PLEASE take your time and DO NOT skip any steps.
- Follow all naming conventions (compartment, group, etc..) and passwords as directed.   
- IP addresses and URLs in the screenshots in this workbook may differ from what you use in the labs as these are dynamically generated.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Set up an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Account (Prerequisites) 
* Create Identity and Access Management (IAM) Resources (Lab 1) 
* Provision the Peoplesoft Cloud Manager using Marketplace (Lab 2)
* Configure Cloud Manager Settings (Lab 3)
* Subscribe to PeopleSoft Channels (Lab 4)
* Review and Update a Topology (Lab 5)
* Create a New Environment Template (Lab 6)
* Create Environment in PeopleSoft (Lab 7)



### Prerequisites
* User already has a tenancy with Administrator user access. If not, please reach out to us during the session so that we can help you to create windows instance. 
* My Oracle Support (MOS) credentials. Please make sure that you can successfully login to [Oracle Support](https://support.oracle.com). Note down this login credential in a notepad. You will use it later to configure Cloud Manager.
* User should have their own workstation/laptop to access the OCI console, PSFT Cloud Manager, and provisioned instances. 
* User has access to a workstation/laptop with the following installed:
    * If you have a windows machine, please download Git Bash for Windows from here: https://git-scm.com/download/win. Please also download Putty from the following site: https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html. In the Package Files section, click on an installer depending on 32/64 bits.
    * Firefox to connect to Cloud Manager PIA.
    * A different web browser (i.e. Chrome) to connect to OCI web console. 

## Appendix

*Terminology*

The following terms are commonly employed in Peoplesoft cloud operations and used throughout our documentation:

**Availability Domain** – One or more data centers located within a region.

**Bucket** – A logical container used by Object Storage for storing your data and files. A bucket can contain an unlimited number of objects.

**Compartments** – Allows you to organize and control access to your cloud resources. A compartment is a collection of related resources (such as instances, virtual cloud networks, block volumes) that can be accessed only by certain groups.

**Peoplesoft Cloud Manager (PSFT)** - Oracle Peoplesoft Cloud Manager is a Peoplesoft lifecycle management application used for creating, managing, and configuring Peoplesoft environments on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.

**PSFT Cloud Manager infrastructure** – Virtual network resources, compute resources, and policies required to run PSFT Cloud Manager on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.

**Virtual Cloud Network (VCN)** – Networking and compute resources required to run PSFT on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. The PSFT VCN includes the recommended networking resources (VCN, subnets routing tables, internet gateway, security lists, and security rules) to run Oracle Peoplesoft on OCI.

**Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)** – Combines the elasticity and utility of public cloud with the granular control, security, and predictability of on-premises infrastructure to deliver high-performance, high availability, and cost-effective infrastructure services.

**Region** – Oracle Cloud Infrastructure are hosted in regions, which are located in different metropolitan areas. Regions are completely independent of other regions and can be separated by vast distances – across countries or even continents. Generally, you would deploy an application in the region where it is most heavily used, since using nearby resources is faster than using distant resources.

**Subnet, Private** - Instances created in priate subnets do not have direct access to the Internet. In this lab, we will be provisioning the Cloud Manager stack in Resource Manager, and creating private subnets. We will then choose to create a "jump host", or bastion host, as part of the installation. The IP for a private subnet cannot be accessed directly from the Internet. To access our CM instance in a private subnet, we will set up a jump host to enable SSH tunneling and Socket Secure (SOCKS) proxy connection to the Cloud Manager web server (PIA). The jump host is created using an Oracle Linux platform image, and will be created inside the VCN.

**Subnet, Public** - Instances that you create in a public subnet have public IP addresses, and can be accessed from the Internet.

**Tenancy** – When you sign up for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, Oracle creates a tenancy for your company, which is a secure and isolated partition within Oracle Cloud Infrastructure where you can create, organize, and administer your cloud resources.
