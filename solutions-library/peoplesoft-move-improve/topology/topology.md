# Reviewing and Updating a Topology

## Introduction

Cloud Manager provisions PeopleSoft environments on-demand with just a few clicks. The entire provisioning process is automated. At the end of provisioning, a ready-to-use environment is available within a short time. The environments can be created by a three step process:
1. Create Topology
2. Create Template
3. Create Environment

Topology defines the infrastructure layout that will be created on Oracle Cloud by Cloud Manager. An administrator defines a template for creating an environment. The topology is encapsulated inside the template. 

Users can select a template, override topologies, change any attributes, if needed, and provision PeopleSoft environments on demand. Users are allowed to perform actions on a running environment, such as stop, view details, create new template from it, and so on.

Estimated Time: 5 minutes

### Objectives
In this lab you will:
* Create a topolgy for a template to automatically provision a PeopleSoft environment
* Give it required attributes including name, description, OS, shape type, and environment type

### Prerequisites
- Access to the Cloud Manager console.

## **STEP 1**: Defining a Topology

1.	Navigate to **Dashboard** > **Topology**.
    Click the radio button next to **PUM Fulltier** and then click **Clone**

    Give the cloned Topology a name: **Fulltier** and click **Clone**

2. Now let's edit the Topogy we just created. 
    Click **Fulltier**
    ![](./images/editFull.png "")

    You should see 2 Nodes like this:

3.  Click **Full Tier** under Environment Type and select **VM.Standard2.1**

    Click **Done**.

    Now, let's edit the other node. Click **PeopleSoft Client** and then **Delete** this node.

4.	When you have something like this, click **Save**.

You may now proceed to the next lab.
