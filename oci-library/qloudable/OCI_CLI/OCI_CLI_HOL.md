## Overview

Automation is a critical component when it comes to managing Cloud workloads at scale.  Although the OCI UI is user-friendly, many tasks may be repetitive and could further reduce an administrator's effort if they can be automated. The OCI Command Line Interface (CLI) is a toolkit developed in Python that is capable of performing almost any task that can be executed in the OCI UI.  The toolkit runs on Linux, Mac, and Windows, making it easy to write BASH or PowerShell scripts that perform a series of commands when executed.

This lab will walk you through installation and configuration of the CLI, along with the execution of several create, read, and terminate commands.  Upon completion of this lab you should have a good understanding of how to use the OCI CLI to automate common tasks in OCI.

***We will now test the functionality of the CLI***

## Testing the CLI, Create another VCN with one public subnet

1. In the SSH terminal session, type the following command:

```
oci iam availability-domain list
```

This will list all availability domains in the current region.  Make note of one of the availability domain names.  It should look something like this ``nESu:PHX-AD-3``.  You will use this in a future step.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/oci-library/qloudable/OCI_CLI/img/100_CLI_001.png" alt="image-alt-text">

2. Return to the OCI Console and navigate to Identity -> Compartments.  Retrieve the OCID of the assigned compartment.

3. Enter the following command to list VCN's:
```bash
oci network vcn list --compartment-id <your compartment id>
```

 <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/oci-library/qloudable/OCI_CLI/img/100_CLI_003.png" alt="image-alt-text">

**NOTE:** It should return the details of the VCN you created at the start of this lab.  If you encounter an error message, please contact the instructor.

**TIP:** You can create an environment variable for your compartment ID to avoid having to paste it each time.
```bash
export cid=<your compartment ocid>
oci network vcn list --compartment-id $cid
```

4. Create a new virtual cloud network with a unique CIDR block.  You will need the OCID of your compartment.
```bash
oci network vcn create --cidr-block 192.168.0.0/16 -c <your compartment OCID> --display-name CLI-Demo-VCN --dns-label clidemovcn
```
Record the ``id:`` of the resource after it is created.  You will need it in the upcoming steps.

5. Create a new security list
```
oci network security-list create --display-name PubSub1 --vcn-id <your VCN OCID> -c $cid --egress-security-rules  '[{"destination": "0.0.0.0/0", "destination-type": "CIDR_BLOCK", "protocol": "all", "isStateless": false}]' --ingress-security-rules '[{"source": "0.0.0.0/0", "source-type": "CIDR_BLOCK", "protocol": 6, "isStateless": false, "tcp-options": {"destination-port-range": {"max": 80, "min": 80}}}]'
```
Make a note of the resource ``id:`` for use in the next step.

6. Create a public subnet.
```bash
oci network subnet create --cidr-block 192.168.10.0/24 -c <your compartment OCID> --vcn-id <your VCN OCID> --security-list-ids '["<security list OCID from previous step>"]'
```
Record the ``id:`` of the resources after it is created.  You will need it in an upcoming step.

**Note:** You have the option to specify up to 5 security lists and a custom route table.  In this case, we are only assigning one security list and allowing the system to automatically associate the default route table.

7. Create an Internet Gateway.  You will need the OCID of your VCN and Compartment.
```bash
oci network internet-gateway create -c <your compartment OCID> --is-enabled true --vcn-id <your VCN OCID> --display-name DemoIGW
```
Make a note of the ``id:`` for this resource after it has been created.

8. Next, we will update the default route table with a route to the internet gateway.  First, you will need to locate the OCID of the default route table.

```bash
oci network route-table list -c <your compartment OCID> --vcn-id <your VCN OCID>
```
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/oci-library/qloudable/OCI_CLI/img/100_CLI_004.png" alt="image-alt-text">

record the ``id:`` of the `Default Route Table`

9. Update the route table with a route to the internet gateway.
```bash
oci network route-table update --rt-id <route table OCID> --route-rules '[{"cidrBlock":"0.0.0.0/0","networkEntityId":"<your Internet Gateway OCID>"}]'
```

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/oci-library/qloudable/OCI_CLI/img/100_CLI_004.png" alt="image-alt-text">

**Note:** When updating route tables or security lists you cannot insert a single rule.  You must ``update`` with the entire set of rules.  The prompt shown in the screenshot above illustrates this point.

**Use QUERY to find Oracle Linux Image ID, then launch a compute instance**

10. Use the CLI ``query`` command to retrieve the OCID for the latest Oracle Linux image.  Make a note of the image ID for future use.
```bash
oci compute image list --compartment-id <your compartment OCID> --query 'data[?contains("display-name",`Oracle-Linux-7.6-20`)]|[0:1].["display-name",id]'
```

You may find more information on the Query command here:
https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#ManagingCLIInputandOutput

11. Launch a compute instance with the following command.  We previously created a regional subnet because our command did not include a specific availability domain. For compute instances, we must specify an availability domain and subnet.

You will need the following pieces of information:


- Availability domain name
- Subnet OCID
- Valid compute shape (i.e. VM.Standard.E2.1)
- Your public SSH key

```bash
oci compute instance launch --availability-domain <your AD name> --display-name demo-instance --image-id <ID from previous step> --subnet-id <subnet OCID> --shape VM.Standard.E2.1 --compartment-id <Compartment_ID> --assign-public-ip true --metadata '{"ssh_authorized_keys": "<your public ssh key here>"}'
```
Capture the ``id:`` of the compute instance launch output.

12. Check the status of the instances
```bash
oci compute instance get --instance-id <the instance OCID> --query 'data."lifecycle-state"'
```

13. Rerun the command every 30-60 seconds until the lifecycle-state is ``RUNNING``

***This completes the exercise for basic usage of the OCI CLI.***

**Bonus Exercise: Use the CLI to create the rest of the VCN resources**

This section is optional and does not contain detailed instructions.  Instead, there are a series of objectives that you will complete on your own.  Use the OCI CLI reference documentation for guidance.
https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/tools/oci-cli/latest/oci_cli_docs/index.html

14. Locate the public IP address of the instance using the CLI
```bash
oci compute instance list-vnics --instance-id <instance OCID> | grep "ip.:"
```

15. Attempt to connect via SSH.  Does it work? (hint: it should time out)

16. Use the CLI to create an ingress rule for SSH traffic in your custom security list.  Don't forget the ``oci network security-list update`` command requires you to pass all current and new rules.  If you just pass one rule, it will overwrite the existing rules.

17. Connect via SSH now.  Is it working?

18. Create and attach a 50GB block volume to your instance.

19. Terminate / destroy all of the resources you created in this lab.  Hint: the order in which you delete the resources is very important.

20. Delete the Block volume, then compute instance and then VCN. Example command to delete VCN

```bash
 oci network vcn delete --vcn-id <YOUR_VCN_OCID>  
```

## Delete the resources

1. Switch to  OCI console window

2. If your Compute instance is not displayed, From OCI services menu Click **Instances** under **Compute**

3. Locate first compute instance, Click Action icon and then **Terminate**
