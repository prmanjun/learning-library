8. The New MySQL DB System will be ready to use after a few minutes. The state will be shown as Creating during the creation.
    ![MDS](./images/04mysql06.png" ")

9. The state Active indicates that the DB System is ready to use. 

    Check the MySQL endpoint (Address) under Instances in the MySQL DB System Details page. 

    ![MDS](./images/04mysql07.png" ")

## **STEP 5:** Create Client Virtual Machine

1. You will need a client machine to connect to your brand new MySQL database. To launch a Linux Compute instance, go to the Console, menu Compute, Instances
    ![COMPUTE](./images/05compute01.png " ")

2. On Instances in MDS_Sandbox Compartment, click on Create Instance.
    ![COMPUTE](./images/05compute02.png " ")

3. On Create Compute Instance enter **MDS_Client**  for the instance Name. 
    
4. Make sure MDS_Sandbox compartment is selected. 
 
5. Choose an operating system or image source (for this lab , select Oracle Linux), 
 
6. Edit Configure placement and hardware
   
   Select the Availability Domain, Instance Shape (select VM.Standard.E2.1.Micro).

    ![COMPUTE](./images/05compute03.png " ")

   For VCN make sure MDS_VCN is selected, "Assign a public IP address" should be set to Yes.  
    ![COMPUTE](./images/05compute04.png " ")


7. If you have not already created your SSH key, perform "Lab 1: Create Local SSH Key". 
    
   When you are done return to the next line (STEP 5: #8) .

8.  Add SSH Keys: Select CHOOSE SSH KEY FILES and browse to select the
SSH public key, which was created earlier. (In this example it is id_rsa).

    ![COMPUTE](./images/05compute06.png " ")

9. The New Virtual Machine will be ready to use after a few minutes. The state will be shown as Provisioning during the creation
    ![COMPUTE](./images/05compute07.png " ")

10.	The state Running indicates that the Virtual Machine is ready to use. 

    Save the Public IP Address under Primary VNIC Information on the Instance page. 
    ![COMPUTE](./images/05compute08.png " ")

## **STEP 6:** Connect to MySQL Database

1. If you are a Linux or Mac user go to STEP 6: #2

   If you are a Windows user click Start menu from your windows machine for Git which should include the Git Bash command.

    Click on the Git Bash command. This will take you to the Git Bash terminal as shown below and continue to  STEP 6: #2. 
    ![Connect](./images/06connect0.png" ")

2.  From a terminal window on your local system. Connect to the Compute Instance with the SSH command. 

    Indicate the location of the private key you created earlier with MDS_Client. Enter the username opc and the Public IP Address.

    Note: The **MDS_Client**  shows the  Public IP Address as mentioned on Step 4: #9
    
    (Example: **ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa opc@&132.145.170.990**)

    `$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa opc@&<your_compute_instance_ip>;`

    ![Connect](./images/06connect01.png " ")

3. You will need a MySQL client tool to connect to your new MySQL DB System from your client machine. 

    Install MySQL release package  with the following command:

    `[opc@...]$ sudo yum -y install https://dev.mysql.com/get/mysql80-community-release-el7-3.noarch.rpm`

    ![Connect](./images/06connect03.png " ")

    Install MySQL Shell with the following command 

    `[opc@...]$ sudo yum install â€“y mysql-shell`
    ![Connect](./images/06connect05.png " ")
 
4. From your Compute instance, connect to MySQL using the MySQL Shell client tool. 
    
   The endpoint (IP Address) can be found in the MySQL DB System Details page, under the "Endpoints" resource. 

    ![Connect](./images/06connect06.png " ")

5.  Use the following command to connect to MySQL using the MySQL Shell client tool.

    (Example  **mysqlsh -uadmin -p -h132.145.170.990**)
    
    `[opc@...]$ mysqlsh -u<MDS_admin_username> -p -h<MDS_endpoint>`

    ![Connect](./images/06connect07.png " ")

6. (Optional) At this point, you can also use MySQL Workbench from your local machine to connect to the MySQL endpoint using your new Compute instance as a jump box. 

   In your pre installed MySQL Workbench, 
   
   configure a connection using the method "Standard TCP/IP over SSH" 
   
   and use the credentials of the Compute instance for SSH. 
   
   MySQL Workbench Configuration for MDS:

    ![Connect](./images/06workbench01.png " ")

   MySQL Workbench Launched for MDS:

    ![Connect](./images/06workbench02.png " ")

## **STEP 7:** Clean up the resources

1. Delete the MySQL DB System.
    ![Clean](./images/07clean01.png " ")

2. Terminate the Compute instance.
    ![Clean](./images/07clean02.png " ")

3. Delete the Virtual Cloud Network.
    ![Clean](./images/07clean03.png " ")

4. Delete the MySQL policies for the compartment.
    ![Clean](./images/07clean04.png " ")
