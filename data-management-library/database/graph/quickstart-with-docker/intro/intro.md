# Introduction

## About this Workshop

In this workshop, you will work with Docker images for an Oracle Database and deploy the Oracle Property Graph Server and Client components into a Linux Docker image.

Next, you will load data, create a graph, and query and analyze the graph and visualize query results. The data consists of information about customers, their social network, their accounts, their purchases, and the stores where they made these purchases.

Estimated Workshop Time: 130 minutes.

### About Oracle Property Graph

Property graphs have become a useful way to model, manage, query, and analyze much of the connected data found in todayâ€™s applications and information systems.  They allow you to represent data based on relationships and connectivity, query data by traversing those connections and analyze data using algorithms that evaluate the strength of the connections, patterns, and anomalies in the graph, the importance of elements in the graph, and other factors.

Oracle Database property graph support consists of graph storage, indexing, and search; a powerful in-memory analyst with 50 built-in, parallel analytic functions; a graph query language, and developer APIs. Graph algorithms enable you to explore and discover relationships in social networks, IoT, big data, data warehouses, and complex transaction data for applications such as fraud detection in banking, customer 360, and smart manufacturing.
