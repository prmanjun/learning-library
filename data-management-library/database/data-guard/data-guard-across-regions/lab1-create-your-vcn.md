8. Give your VCN a name of your choice.

9. Enter a CIDR block.  The CIDR block must not be the same as your cross region CIDR block because we will need to peer them together later so they must be different.  

ie: 10.0.0.0/16 for one region and 11.0.0.0/16 for the peer region.

10. Update your subnet CIDR block accordingly.

11. Click Next and then Click Create.  Your cloud network will be created quickly.
12. Now do the same steps and create another VCN on your peer region.  

Switch to your peer region and create your VCN.  Remember it must be in the same compartment but with a different CIDR block.
