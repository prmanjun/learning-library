# Introduction

In this section of the workshop, you will work on upgrading Oracle Databases using the AutoUpgrade utility. The AutoUpgrade utility identifies issues before upgrades, performs pre- and postupgrade actions, deploys upgrades, performs postupgrade actions, and starts the upgraded Oracle, without human intervention.

The AutoUpgrade utility is designed to automate the upgrade process, both before starting upgrades, during upgrade deployments, and during postupgrade checks and configuration migration. You use AutoUpgrade after you have downloaded binaries for the new Oracle Database release, and set up new release Oracle homes. When you use AutoUpgrade, you can upgrade multiple Oracle Database deployments at the same time, using a single configuration file, customized as needed for each database deployment. AutoUpgrade can also be used to upgrade non-CDB databases to PDB databases.

Estimated Workshop Time: 60 minutes
