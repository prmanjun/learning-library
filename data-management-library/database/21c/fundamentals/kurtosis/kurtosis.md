# Measuring Tailedness of Data with the KURTOSIS Functions

## Introduction
This lab shows how to use the `KURTOSIS_POP` and `KURTOSIS_SAMP` aggregate functions to measure tailedness of data. Higher kurtosis means more of the variance is the result of infrequent extreme deviations, as opposed to frequent modestly sized deviations. A normal distribution has a kurtosis of zero.

Estimated Lab Time: 10 minutes

### Objectives
In this lab, you will:
* Setup the environment

### Prerequisites

* An Oracle Free Tier, Paid or LiveLabs Cloud Account
* Lab: SSH Keys
* Lab: Create a DBCS VM Database
* Lab: 21c Setup


## **STEP 1:** Set up the environment

1. Connect to `PDB1` as `HR` and execute the `/home/oracle/labs/M104784GC10/Houses_Prices.sql` SQL  script to create a table with data.

     ```

     $ <copy>cd /home/oracle/labs/M104784GC10</copy>
     $ <copy>sqlplus system@PDB1</copy>

     ERROR at line 1:
     ORA-00942: table or view does not exist

     SQL> CREATE TABLE houses (house NUMBER, price_big_city NUMBER, price_small_city NUMBER, price_date DATE);

     Table created.

     SQL> INSERT INTO houses VALUES (1,100000,10000, sysdate);

     1 row created.

     SQL> INSERT INTO houses VALUES (1,200000,15000, sysdate+1);

     1 row created.

     SQL> INSERT INTO houses VALUES (1,300000,25000, sysdate+1);

     1 row created.

     ...

     SQL> COMMIT;

     Commit complete.

     SQL>

     ```

## **STEP 2:** Examine the kurtosis of the distribution

1. Display the table rows. The `HOUSE` column values refer to types of house that you want to look at and categorize the data that you look at statistically and compare with each other.


     ```

     SQL> <copy>SET PAGES 100</copy>

     SQL> <copy>SELECT * FROM houses;</copy>

     SQL>

     ```

2. Display the result of population kurtosis (`KURTOSIS_POP`) and sample kurtosis (`KURTOSIS_SAMP`) for the three types of houses.


     ```

     SQL> <copy>SELECT house, kurtosis_pop(price_big_city), kurtosis_pop(price_small_city) FROM houses
          GROUP BY house;</copy>

          HOUSE KURTOSIS_POP(PRICE_BIG_CITY) KURTOSIS_POP(PRICE_SMALL_CITY)

     ---------- ---------------------------- ------------------------------

               1                        -1.23                      -.7058169

               2                        -.212                     .245200191

               3                         -1.3                     -1.5417881

     SQL> <copy>SELECT house, kurtosis_samp(price_big_city), kurtosis_samp(price_small_city) FROM houses
          GROUP BY house;</copy>

          HOUSE KURTOSIS_SAMP(PRICE_BIG_CITY) KURTOSIS_SAMP(PRICE_SMALL_CITY)

     ---------- ----------------------------- -------------------------------

               1                          -1.2                        -.201556

               2                         3.152                      4.98080076

               3                          -1.2                      -2.1671526

     SQL>

     ```

  `PRICE_SMALL_CITY` has a higher kurtosis compared to `PRICE_BIG_CITY`. Observe whether there is more data in the tails or around the peak in `PRICE_SMALL_CITY` and in `PRICE_BIG_CITY`.

## **STEP 3:** Examine the kurtosis of the distribution after data evolution

1. Insert more rows in the table.


     ```

     SQL> <copy>INSERT INTO houses SELECT * FROM houses;</copy>

     19 rows created.

     SQL> <copy>/</copy>

     38 rows created.

     SQL> <copy>/</copy>

     76 rows created.

     SQL> <copy>/</copy>

     152 rows created.

     SQL> <copy>COMMIT;</copy>

     Commit complete.

     SQL> <copy>SELECT house, KURTOSIS_POP(price_big_city), KURTOSIS_POP(price_small_city) FROM houses
          GROUP BY house ORDER BY 1;</copy>

          HOUSE KURTOSIS_POP(PRICE_BIG_CITY) KURTOSIS_POP(PRICE_SMALL_CITY)

     ---------- ---------------------------- ------------------------------

               1                        -1.23                      -.7058169

               2                        -.212                     .245200191

               3                         -1.3                     -1.5417881

     SQL> <copy>SELECT house, KURTOSIS_SAMP(price_big_city), KURTOSIS_SAMP(price_small_city) FROM houses
          GROUP BY house ORDER BY 1;</copy>

          HOUSE KURTOSIS_SAMP(PRICE_BIG_CITY) KURTOSIS_SAMP(PRICE_SMALL_CITY)

     ---------- ----------------------------- -------------------------------

               1                    -1.2309485                      -.68809876

               2                    -.14695105                      .340165838

               3                    -1.3061439                      -1.5637533

     SQL>

     ```

  As you can see, as the number of values in the data set increases, the difference between the computed values of `KURTOSIS_SAMP` and `KURTOSIS_POP` decreases.

2. Determine the kurtosis of distinct values in columns `PRICE_SMALL_CITY` and `PRICE_BIG_CITY`.


     ```

     SQL> <copy>SELECT house,
                         KURTOSIS_POP(DISTINCT price_big_city) pop_big_city,
                         KURTOSIS_SAMP(DISTINCT price_big_city) samp_big_city,
                         KURTOSIS_POP(DISTINCT price_small_city) pop_small_city,
                         KURTOSIS_SAMP(DISTINCT price_small_city) samp_small_city  
                    FROM houses
                    GROUP BY house;</copy>

          HOUSE POP_BIG_CITY SAMP_BIG_CITY POP_SMALL_CITY SAMP_SMALL_CITY

     ---------- ------------ ------------- -------------- ---------------

               1        -1.23          -1.2      -.7058169        -.201556

               2        -.212         3.152     .245200191      4.98080076

               3         -1.3          -1.2     -1.5417881      -2.1671526

     SQL>

     ```

  Is the result much different if the query does not evaluate the distinct values in columns `PRICE_BIG_CITY` and `PRICE_SMALL_CITY`?


     ```

     SQL> <copy>SELECT house,
                         KURTOSIS_POP(price_big_city) pop_big_city,
                         KURTOSIS_SAMP(price_big_city) samp_big_city,
                         KURTOSIS_POP(price_small_city) pop_small_city,
                         KURTOSIS_SAMP(price_small_city) samp_small_city  
                    FROM houses
                    GROUP BY house;</copy>

          HOUSE POP_BIG_CITY SAMP_BIG_CITY POP_SMALL_CITY SAMP_SMALL_CITY

     ---------- ------------ ------------- -------------- ---------------

               1        -1.23    -1.2309485      -.7058169      -.68809876

               2        -.212    -.14695105     .245200191      .340165838

               3         -1.3    -1.3061439     -1.5417881      -1.5637533

     SQL>

     ```

  The population tailedness value is not different because the same exact rows were inserted.

3. Insert more rows in the table with a big data set for `HOUSE` number 1.


     ```

     SQL> <copy>INSERT INTO houses (house, price_big_city, price_small_city)
                    SELECT house, price_big_city*0.5, price_small_city*0.1
                    FROM houses WHERE house=1;</copy>

     144 rows created.

     SQL> <copy>/</copy>

     288 rows created.

     SQL> <copy>/</copy>

     576 rows created.

     SQL> <copy>/</copy>

     1152 rows created.

     SQL> <copy>/</copy>

     2304 rows created.

     SQL> <copy>COMMIT;</copy>

     Commit complete.

     SQL> <copy>SELECT house, count(house) FROM houses GROUP BY house ORDER BY 1;</copy>

          HOUSE COUNT(HOUSE)

     ---------- ------------

               1         4608

               2           80

               3           80



     SQL> <copy>SELECT house,
                         KURTOSIS_POP(price_big_city) pop_big_city,
                         KURTOSIS_SAMP(price_big_city) samp_big_city,
                         KURTOSIS_POP(price_small_city) pop_small_city,
                         KURTOSIS_SAMP(price_small_city) samp_small_city  
                    FROM houses
                    GROUP BY house;</copy>

          HOUSE POP_BIG_CITY SAMP_BIG_CITY POP_SMALL_CITY SAMP_SMALL_CITY

     ---------- ------------ ------------- -------------- ---------------

               1   9.12746931    9.13868421     33.7452495      33.7831972

               2        -.212    -.14695105     .245200191      .340165838

               3         -1.3    -1.3061439     -1.5417881      -1.5637533

     SQL> <copy>EXIT</copy>

     $

     ```

  Now the tailedness of the data becomes positive for house number 1 which means that data is skewed to right. `PRICE_SMALL_CITY` has a much higher kurtosis compared to `PRICE_BIG_CITY`. This implies that in `PRICE_SMALL_CITY`, more of the variance is the result of many infrequent extreme deviations, whereas in `PRICE_BIG_CITY`, the variance is attributed to very frequent modestly sized deviations.
