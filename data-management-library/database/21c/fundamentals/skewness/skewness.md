# Measuring Asymmetry in Data with the SKEWNESS Functions

## Introduction

This lab shows how to use the `SKEWNESS_POP` and `SKEWNESS_SAMP` aggregate functions to measure asymmetry in data. For a given set of values, the result of population skewness (`SKEWNESS_POP`) and sample skewness (`SKEWNESS_SAMP`) are always deterministic.

Estimated Lab Time: 5 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Setup the environment

### Prerequisites

* An Oracle Free Tier, Paid or LiveLabs Cloud Account
* Lab: SSH Keys
* Lab: Create a DBCS VM Database
* Lab: 21c Setup


## **STEP 1:** Set up the environment

1. Connect to `PDB1` as `HR` and execute the `/home/oracle/labs/M104784GC10/Houses_Prices.sql` SQL  script to create a table with skewed data.

	```

	$ <copy>cd /home/oracle/labs/M104784GC10</copy>
	$ <copy>sqlplus system@PDB1</copy>

	```
	SQL> <copy>@/home/oracle/labs/M104784GC10/Houses_Prices.sql</copy>
	SQL> SET ECHO ON
	SQL>SQL> DROP TABLE houses;
	DROP TABLE houses
			*
	ERROR at line 1:
	ORA-00942: table or view does not exist

	SQL> CREATE TABLE houses (house NUMBER, price_big_city NUMBER, price_small_city NUMBER, price_date DATE);

	Table created.

	SQL> INSERT INTO houses VALUES (1,100000,10000, sysdate);

	1 row created.
	...
	SQL> INSERT INTO houses VALUES (1,900000,40000, sysdate+5);

	1 row created.
	...
	SQL> COMMIT;

	Commit complete.

	SQL>

	```

## **STEP 2:** Examine skewed data

1. Display the table rows. The `HOUSE` column values refer to types of house that you want to look at and categorize the data that you look at statistically and compare with each other. With Skewness, you measure whether there is more data towards the left or the right end of the tail (positive/negative) or how close you are to a normal distribution (skewness = 0).

	SQL> <copy>SELECT * FROM houses;</copy>

2. Display the result of population skewness prices (`SKEWNESS_POP`) and sample skewness prices (`SKEWNESS_SAMP`) for the three houses in the table.


	```

	SQL> <copy>SELECT house, count(house) FROM houses GROUP BY house ORDER BY 1;</copy>

		HOUSE COUNT(HOUSE)

	---------- ------------

			1            9

			2            5

			3            5

	SQL> <copy>SELECT house, SKEWNESS_POP(price_big_city), SKEWNESS_POP(price_small_city) FROM houses
				GROUP BY house;</copy>

		HOUSE SKEWNESS_POP(PRICE_BIG_CITY) SKEWNESS_POP(PRICE_SMALL_CITY)

	---------- ---------------------------- ------------------------------

			1                            0                     -.66864012

			2                   1.13841996                     1.49637083

			3                            0                     -.12735442

	SQL> <copy>SELECT house, SKEWNESS_SAMP(price_big_city), SKEWNESS_SAMP(price_small_city) FROM houses
				GROUP BY house;</copy>

		HOUSE SKEWNESS_SAMP(PRICE_BIG_CITY) SKEWNESS_SAMP(PRICE_SMALL_CITY)

	---------- ----------------------------- -------------------------------

			1                             0                      -.81051422

			2                    1.69705627                      2.23065793

			3                             0                      -.18984876

	SQL>

	```

  *Skewness is important in a situation where `PRICE_BIG_CITY` and `PRICE_SMALL_CITY` represent the prices of houses to buy and you want to determine whether the outliers in data are biased towards the left end or right end of the distribution, that is, if there are more values to the left of the mean when compared to the number of values to the right of the mean.*

## **STEP 3:** Examine skewed data after data evolution

1. Insert more rows in the table.


	```

	SQL> <copy>INSERT INTO houses SELECT * FROM houses;</copy>

	19 rows created.

	SQL> <copy>/</copy>

	38 rows created.

	SQL> <copy>/</copy>

	76 rows created.

	SQL> <copy>/</copy>

	152 rows created.

	SQL> <copy>COMMIT;</copy>

	Commit complete.

	SQL> <copy>SELECT house, SKEWNESS_POP(price_big_city), SKEWNESS_POP(price_small_city) FROM houses
		GROUP BY house ORDER BY 1;</copy>

		HOUSE SKEWNESS_POP(PRICE_BIG_CITY) SKEWNESS_POP(PRICE_SMALL_CITY)

	---------- ---------------------------- ------------------------------

			1                            0                     -.66864012

			2                   1.13841996                     1.49637083

			3                            0                     -.12735442

	SQL> <copy>SELECT house, SKEWNESS_SAMP(price_big_city), SKEWNESS_SAMP(price_small_city) FROM houses
		GROUP BY house ORDER BY 1;</copy>

		HOUSE SKEWNESS_SAMP(PRICE_BIG_CITY) SKEWNESS_SAMP(PRICE_SMALL_CITY)

	---------- ----------------------------- -------------------------------

			1                             0                      -.67569912

			2                     1.1602897                      1.52511703

			3                             0                      -.12980098

	SQL>

	```

  *As the number of values in the data set increases, the difference between the computed values of `SKEWNESS_SAMP` and `SKEWNESS_POP` decreases.*

2. Determine the skewness of distinct values in columns `PRICE_BIG_CITY` and `PRICE_SMALL_CITY`.


	```

	SQL> <copy>SELECT house,
						SKEWNESS_POP(DISTINCT price_big_city) pop_big_city,
						SKEWNESS_SAMP(DISTINCT price_big_city) samp_big_city,
						SKEWNESS_POP(DISTINCT price_small_city) pop_small_city,
						SKEWNESS_SAMP(DISTINCT price_small_city) samp_small_city  
					FROM houses
					GROUP BY house;</copy>

		HOUSE POP_BIG_CITY SAMP_BIG_CITY POP_SMALL_CITY SAMP_SMALL_CITY

	---------- ------------ ------------- -------------- ---------------

			1            0             0     -.66864012      -.81051422

			2   1.13841996    1.69705627     1.49637083      2.23065793

			3            0             0     -.12735442      -.18984876

	SQL>

	```

  Is the result much different if the query does not evaluate the distinct values in columns `PRICE_BIG_CITY` and `PRICE_SMALL_CITY`?


	```

	SQL> <copy>SELECT house,
						SKEWNESS_POP(price_big_city) pop_big_city,
						SKEWNESS_SAMP(price_big_city) samp_big_city,
						SKEWNESS_POP(price_small_city) pop_small_city,
						SKEWNESS_SAMP(price_small_city) samp_small_city  
					FROM houses
					GROUP BY house;</copy>

		HOUSE POP_BIG_CITY SAMP_BIG_CITY POP_SMALL_CITY SAMP_SMALL_CITY

	---------- ------------ ------------- -------------- ---------------

			1            0             0     -.66864012      -.67569912

			2   1.13841996     1.1602897     1.49637083      1.52511703

			3            0             0     -.12735442      -.12980098

	SQL>

	```

  The population skewness value is not different because the same exact rows were inserted.

3. Insert more rows in the table with a big data set for `HOUSE` number 1.


	```

	SQL> <copy>INSERT INTO houses (house, price_big_city, price_small_city)
					SELECT house, price_big_city*0.5, price_small_city*0.1
					FROM houses WHERE house=1;</copy>

	144 rows created.

	SQL> <copy>/</copy>

	288 rows created.

	SQL> <copy>/</copy>

	576 rows created.

	SQL> <copy>/</copy>

	1152 rows created.

	SQL> <copy>/</copy>

	2304 rows created.

	SQL> <copy>COMMIT;</copy>

	Commit complete.

	SQL> <copy>SELECT house, count(house) FROM houses GROUP BY house ORDER BY 1;</copy>

			HOUSE COUNT(HOUSE)

	---------- ------------

			1         4608

			2           80

			3           80



	SQL> <copy>SELECT house,
						SKEWNESS_POP(price_big_city) pop_big_city,
						SKEWNESS_SAMP(price_big_city) samp_big_city,
						SKEWNESS_POP(price_small_city) pop_small_city,
						SKEWNESS_SAMP(price_small_city) samp_small_city  
					FROM houses
					GROUP BY house;</copy>

		HOUSE POP_BIG_CITY SAMP_BIG_CITY POP_SMALL_CITY SAMP_SMALL_CITY

	---------- ------------ ------------- -------------- ---------------

			1   2.57050631    2.57134341      5.7418481      5.74371797

			2   1.13841996     1.1602897     1.49637083      1.52511703

			3            0             0     -.12735442      -.12980098

	SQL> <copy>EXIT</copy>
