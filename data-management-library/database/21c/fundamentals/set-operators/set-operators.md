# New Set Operators

## Introduction

This lab shows how to use the new set operators, EXCEPT, EXCEPT ALL and INTERSECT ALL.

Estimated Lab Time: 5 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Setup the environment

### Prerequisites

* An Oracle Free Tier, Paid or LiveLabs Cloud Account
* Lab: SSH Keys
* Lab: Create a DBCS VM Database
* Lab: 21c Setup


## **STEP  1**: Set up the environment

In this step you will execute the `/home/oracle/labs/M104783GC10/setup_oe_tables.sh` shell script. The shell script creates and loads the `OE.INVENTORIES`, `OE.ORDERS` and `OE.ORDER_ITEMS` tables.

1.  Change to the lab directory and run the shell script to setup the tables

	```

	$ <copy>cd /home/oracle/labs/M104783GC10</copy>

	```

2. Run the script to setup the Order Entry (OE) tables.

	```
	$ <copy>/home/oracle/labs/M104783GC10/setup_oe_tables.sh</copy>

	...

	Commit complete.

	Disconnected from Oracle Database 21c Enterprise Edition Release 21.0.0.0.0 - Production

	Version 21.2.0.0.0

	$

	```

## **STEP  2**: Test the set operator with the `EXCEPT` clause

1. Connect to `PDB1` as `OE`.


	```

	$ <copy>sqlplus oe@PDB1</copy>

	SQL>

	```

2. Count in both tables, `INVENTORIES` and `ORDER_ITEMS`, respectively the number of products available in the inventory and the number of products that customers ordered.  Start with the `INVENTORIES` table.


	```

	SQL> <copy>SELECT count(distinct product_id) FROM inventories;</copy>

	COUNT(PRODUCT_ID)

	-----------------

				208
	```

3. Run a count in the `ORDER_ITEMS` table.  Note the difference.

	```

	SQL> <copy>SELECT count(distinct product_id) FROM order_items;</copy>

	COUNT(PRODUCT_ID)

	-----------------

				185

	SQL>

	```

4. How many products are in the inventory that were never ordered? Use the `EXCEPT` operator to retrieve only unique rows returned by the first query but not by the second.


	```

	SQL> <copy>SELECT count(*) FROM
			(SELECT product_id FROM inventories
			EXCEPT
			SELECT product_id FROM order_items);</copy>

	COUNT(*)

	----------

		84

	SQL>

	```

5. How many products were ordered that are now missing in the inventory? The order of the queries is relevant for the result.


	```

	SQL> <copy>SELECT count(*) FROM
			(SELECT product_id FROM order_items
					EXCEPT
			SELECT product_id FROM inventories);
		</copy>

	COUNT(*)

	----------

		61

	SQL>

	```

## **STEP  3**: Test the set operator with the `EXCEPT ALL` clause

1. Would the usage of ALL in the set operator defined in a query in a previous step mean anything? Run the SQL statement using the *EXCEPT ALL* operator.

	```

	SQL> <copy>SELECT product_id FROM inventories
		EXCEPT ALL
		SELECT product_id FROM order_items;</copy>

	PRODUCT_ID
	----------
		1729
		1729
		1729
		1729
		1729
		1729
		1733
		1733
		1733
		1733
		1733
		1733
		1733
		1733
		1733
	...
		3502
		3502
		3502
		3502
		3502
		3503
		3503
		3503
		3503
		3503

	826 rows selected.
	```

2. Run the same query but reverse the tables.  

	```
	SQL> <copy>SELECT count(*) FROM
		(SELECT product_id FROM inventories
		EXCEPT ALL
		SELECT product_id FROM order_items);</copy>

	COUNT(*)
	----------
		826

	SQL>

	```

The result shows all rows in the `INVENTORIES` table that contain products that were never ordered all inventories. This does not mean anything relevant. The use of `ALL` in operators must be appropriate.

## **STEP  4**: Test the set operator with the `INTERSECT` clause

1. How many products that were ordered are still orderable? The statement combining the results from two queries with the `INTERSECT` operator returns only those unique rows returned by both queries.

	````
	SQL> <copy>SELECT count(*) FROM
		(SELECT product_id FROM inventories
		INTERSECT
		SELECT product_id FROM order_items);</copy>

	COUNT(*)
	----------
		124

	````

2. Run the sql statement below reversing the intersect clause.

	````
	SQL>
	<copy>
	SELECT count(*) FROM
		(SELECT product_id FROM order_items
		INTERSECT
		SELECT product_id FROM inventories);
		</copy>

	COUNT(*)
	----------
		124

	SQL>

	````

## **STEP  5**: Test the set operator with the `INTERSECT ALL` clause

1. Would the usage of `ALL` in the operator defined in the query in step 8 mean anything?

	```

	SQL> <copy>SELECT count(*) FROM
		(SELECT product_id FROM order_items
		INTERSECT ALL
		SELECT product_id FROM inventories);</copy>

	COUNT(*)
	----------
		286
	```

2. Exit SQL*Plus

	```
	SQL> <copy>exit</copy>
	```

	The result shows all rows in the `INVENTORIES` table that contain products that were ordered. This does not mean that these products were ordered from these warehouses. The query does not mean anything relevant. The use of `ALL` in operators must be appropriate.

You may now [proceed to the next lab](#next).
