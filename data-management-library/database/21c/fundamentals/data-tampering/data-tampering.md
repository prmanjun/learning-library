# Detecting Data Tampering with the CHECKSUM Function

## Introduction
This lab shows how to use the `CHECKSUM` aggregate function to detect changes in a table. The function can be applied on a column, a constant, a bind variable, or an expression involving them. All datatypes except ADT and JSON are supported. The order of the rows in the table does not affect the result.

Estimated Lab Time: 15 minutes

### Objectives
In this lab, you will:
* Setup the environment

### Prerequisites

* An Oracle Free Tier, Paid or LiveLabs Cloud Account
* Lab: SSH Keys
* Lab: Create a DBCS VM Database
* Lab: 21c Setup


## **STEP 1:** Set up the environment

1. Execute the `/home/oracle/labs/M104784GC10/setup_SH_tables.sh` shell script to create and load `SH.SALES` and `SH.TIMES` tables.

    ```

    $ <copy>cd /home/oracle/labs/M104784GC10</copy>
    $ <copy>/home/oracle/labs/M104784GC10/setup_SH_tables.sh</copy>

    ```

## **STEP 2:** Examine data before tampering

1. At the end of each month and fiscal period, for legislative reasons, there is an audit table that stores what was sold. Verify the amount sold at the end of fiscal year 1998.


    ```

    $ <copy>sqlplus system@PDB1</copy>

    Enter password: <b><i>WElcome123##</i></b>
    ```
    ```  
    SQL> <copy>SET PAGES 100</copy>

    SQL> <copy>SELECT amount_sold FROM sh.sales s
              JOIN sh.times t ON (s.time_id = t.time_id)
              WHERE fiscal_month_number = 12 AND fiscal_year = 1998;</copy>

          AMOUNT_SOLD

    -----------

          22.99

          44.99

          7.99

        149.99

    ...

          11.99

          44.99

          49.99

          11.99

          44.99

          27.99

        149.99

          44.99

    12400 rows selected.

    SQL>

    ```

2. Before storing the data for auditing, note the `CHECKSUM` value. This will help you ensure that no one is tampering with old sales.

    ```

      SQL> <copy>SELECT CHECKSUM(amount_sold) FROM sh.sales s
                JOIN sh.times t ON (s.time_id = t.time_id)
                WHERE fiscal_month_number = 12 AND fiscal_year = 1998;</copy>

      CHECKSUM(AMOUNT_SOLD)

      ---------------------

                    793409

      SQL>

    ```

3.  Meanwhile in another terminal session, called SH session, someone executes a batch that updates the amount sold.

    ```

    $ <copy>/home/oracle/labs/M104784GC10/app_SH_tables.sh</copy>				  

    Copyright (c) 1982, 2020, Oracle.  All rights reserved.

    Last Successful login time: Wed Mar 25 2020 03:20:17 +00:00

    Connected to:

    525 rows updated.

    Commit complete.

    $

    ```

## **STEP 3:** Examine data after tampering

1. In the initial terminal session, check that no one tampered with old sales.


    ```

    $ <copy>sqlplus system@PDB1</copy>

    Enter password: <b><i>WElcome123##</i></b>
    ```

    ```

    SQL> <copy>SELECT CHECKSUM(amount_sold) FROM sh.sales s
            JOIN sh.times t ON (s.time_id = t.time_id)
            WHERE fiscal_month_number = 12 AND fiscal_year = 1998;</copy>

    CHECKSUM(AMOUNT_SOLD)

    ---------------------

                  835564

    SQL>

    ```

  Since the checksum value is different from the value retrieved in step 4, someone tampered the data.

2. What happens if someone attempted to tamper with old sales? In the SH session, update some old sales but then rolls the transaction back.


    ```

    $ <copy>sqlplus sh@PDB1</copy>

    Copyright (c) 1982, 2020, Oracle.  All rights reserved.

    Enter password: password

    Last Successful login time: Wed Mar 25 2020 03:28:37 +00:00

    Connected to:
    ```
    ```

    SQL> <copy>UPDATE sh.sales SET amount_sold = amount_sold*2 WHERE time_id='30-NOV-98';</copy>

    525 rows updated.

    SQL> <copy>ROLLBACK;</copy>

    Rollback complete.

    SQL>

    ```

3. In the initial terminal session, check that no one tampered with old sales.


    ```

    SQL> <copy>SELECT CHECKSUM(amount_sold) FROM sh.sales s
        JOIN sh.times t ON (s.time_id = t.time_id)
        WHERE fiscal_month_number = 12 AND fiscal_year = 1998;</copy>

    CHECKSUM(AMOUNT_SOLD)

    ---------------------

                  835564

    SQL>

    ```

  The checksum value for the column is still the same as it was before the rolled back update.

4. Verify also the quantity sold at the end of fiscal year 1998 and the checksum value.


    ```

    SQL> <copy>SELECT DISTINCT quantity_sold FROM sh.sales s
        JOIN sh.times t ON (s.time_id = t.time_id)
        WHERE fiscal_month_number = 12 AND fiscal_year = 1998;</copy>

    QUANTITY_SOLD

    -------------

                1

    SQL>

    ```

  As you can see, the quantity sold for any sales is one.


    ```

    SQL> <copy>SELECT CHECKSUM(quantity_sold) FROM sh.sales s
        JOIN sh.times t ON (s.time_id = t.time_id)
        WHERE fiscal_month_number = 12 AND fiscal_year = 1998;</copy>

    CHECKSUM(QUANTITY_SOLD)

    -----------------------

                          0

    SQL>

    ```

  The checksum value is 0 which is not a distinguishable value from another quantity value.


  What if you use the `DISTINCT` (or `UNIQUE`- `UNIQUE` is an Oracle specific keyword and not an ANSI standard)?


    ```

    SQL> <copy>SELECT CHECKSUM(DISTINCT quantity_sold) FROM sh.sales s
        JOIN sh.times t ON (s.time_id = t.time_id)
        WHERE fiscal_month_number = 12 AND fiscal_year = 1998;</copy>

    CHECKSUM(DISTINCTQUANTITY_SOLD)

    -------------------------------

                            863352

    SQL>

    ```

5. In the SH session, double the quantity for all sales.


    ```

    SQL> <copy>UPDATE sh.sales SET quantity_sold = 2;</copy>

    918843 rows updated.

    SQL> <copy>COMMIT;</copy>

    Commit complete.

    SQL>

    ```

6. In the initial terminal session, check that no one tampered with old sales.


    ```

    SQL> <copy>SELECT CHECKSUM(quantity_sold) FROM sh.sales s
        JOIN sh.times t ON (s.time_id = t.time_id)
        WHERE fiscal_month_number = 12 AND fiscal_year = 1998;</copy>

    CHECKSUM(AMOUNT_SOLD)

    ---------------------

                        0

    SQL>

    ```

    The checksum value for the column is still the same as it was before the committed update.


    ```

      SQL> <copy>SELECT CHECKSUM(DISTINCT quantity_sold) FROM sh.sales s
          JOIN sh.times t ON (s.time_id = t.time_id)
          WHERE fiscal_month_number = 12 AND fiscal_year = 1998;</copy>

      CHECKSUM(DISTINCTQUANTITY_SOLD)

      -------------------------------

                                65515

      SQL>

    ```

  The checksum value for the column is different from the one retrieved previously.

7. How is NULL considered? Still in the initial terminal session, check that no one tampered with customer email addresses.

    - First, get the checksum value of the customer email addresses whose `CUST_INCOME_LEVEL` is equal to 300000 or higher.

    ```

    SQL> <copy>SELECT cust_email FROM sh.customers WHERE cust_income_level ='L: 300,000 and above';</copy>

    CUST_EMAIL
    --------------------------------------------------
    Gowen@company.example.com
    Gowen@company.example.com
    ...
    Krishnan@company.example.com
    Prabu@company.example.com

    1684 rows selected.

    SQL> <copy>SELECT CHECKSUM(cust_email) FROM sh.customers;</copy>

    CHECKSUM(CUST_EMAIL)
    --------------------
                  107013

    SQL><copy> SELECT CHECKSUM(DISTINCT cust_email) FROM sh.customers;</copy>

    CHECKSUM(DISTINCTCUST_EMAIL)
    ----------------------------
                          227092

    SQL>

    ```

    - In the SH session, the user sets the customer email addresses to NULL for customers whose `CUST_INCOME_LEVEL` is equal to 300000 or higher.

    ```

    SQL> <copy>UPDATE sh.customers SET cust_email = NULL
         WHERE cust_income_level ='L: 300,000 and above';</copy>

    1684 rows updated.

    SQL> <copy>COMMIT;</copy>

    Commit complete.

    SQL>

    ```

    - In the initial terminal session, get the new checksum value of customer email addresses of customers whose `CUST_INCOME_LEVEL` is equal to 300000 or higher after the update.

    ```

    SQL> <copy>SELECT DISTINCT cust_email FROM sh.customers WHERE cust_income_level ='L: 300,000 and above';</copy>

    CUST_EMAIL
    --------------------------------------------------


    SQL> <copy>SELECT CHECKSUM(cust_email) FROM sh.customers;</copy>

    CHECKSUM(CUST_EMAIL)
    --------------------
                  577487

    SQL> <copy>SELECT CHECKSUM(DISTINCT cust_email) FROM sh.customers;</copy>

    CHECKSUM(DISTINCTCUST_EMAIL)
    ----------------------------
                          141231


    SQL> <copy>EXIT</copy>
    $

    ```
    *Be aware that NULL values in `CHECKSUM` column are ignored in external tables.*
